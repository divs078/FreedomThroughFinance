  <td class="context">Women are better educated and holding more high-power jobs than ever, and yet still lag behind men when it comes to saving and investing for retirement, according to 19 Facts About Women’s Retirement Outlook, a report by the Transamerica Center for Retirement Studies. The median household retirement savings for women is just $23,000, compared to $76,000 among men, and almost one-third of women say they have saved less than $10,000 for retirement — or nothing at all.</td>

   <p class="content1"> 
     It may seem tedious, but learning to manage your own money is essential. It may seem natural to pass on money decisions to one’s father or brother or husband, but do not do this. There are resources online where you can learn the basics of money management. Do not give up power to anyone else. You can definitely consult family members, but make your own decisions and maintain a separate bank account.

  <li class="mainpoint"> Invest wisely <br>
      <p class="content3">
        Every woman needs to put herself first. Yes, family and kids are a priority, but you also have to think about your financial security. So start investing early. Start with small recurring deposits, fixed deposits, and SIPs. Let the power of compounding work its magic. This money will prove valuable in future, whether it is to buy a home, travel, help in your child’s education or marriage, etc. Investing in gold is also a good move.
        </p>
  </li>

  <li class="mainpoint"> Cut down expenses <br>
      <p class="content4">
        Draw up a list of things/expenses you can do without. Eat out only once a week. Shop less – after all, one can only wear so many clothes and shoes. Meet friends at home instead of going to cafes and pubs. Set a monthly budget for toys instead of giving in to your kids’ every whim. You will realise it is possible to give up or ration whatever you can without it having a major impact on your lifestyle or comfort.

  <li class="mainpoint"> Make a retirement plan <br>
      <p class="content6">
        Invest in a plan that will take care of all your needs. Do not rely on anyone – no, not even your children. It’s great if they help, but build a safety net if they don’t. Do not give away your home or precious belongings to your kids just yet; you can always leave it to them in your will. Invest in a monthly income plan and build a corpus for your retirement phase. This will ensure you have an income every month, say 40 years from now, and will be financially independent.

    Importance of saving
    <br>
    <p class="content7">
Women face a different set of financial-planning challenges than men because they tend to live longer, earn less, and take more breaks from the work force. Women may also experience more difficulties if they are widowed or divorced which is why they tend to save more.
